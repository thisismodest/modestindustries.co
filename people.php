      <h2>Marcus</h2>
      <p>Marcus is the mutt who never found his place, but don't feel bad for him because in doing so he learned (and continues to learn) so so much, to the point where the only way he can continue to do all of the things he loves is by founding this place, Modest Industries, as his creative outlet. He gets to gallivant about making stuff and our clients get a passion that's not often seen. Win win.</p>

      <h2>Steve</h2>
      <p>Steve is the guy who knows what needs to be known about back-end technologies and databases. Does that sound boring? Most likely, however, having a solid back-end and a well designed database means quality data and fast speeds. If all the websites that used databases didn't exist... well, that <em>would</em> be boring.</p>

      <h2>Solly</h2>
      <p>Behind the magical charm, chiselled muscles and ravishing good looks (like really, really, ridiculously good looking) he's just like the rest of us. Except I forgot to mention that he's also really smart and knows his way around a computer. From build to code â€“ this guy's front-end skill is incredible... but he won't tell you that. That's why we like him.</p>

      <h2>Charlotte</h2>
      <p>Some say she's only here because she's sleeping with the boss (he <em>is</em> dreamy), but once you see what she can do you'll soon realise that behind her perfectly styled hair and beautiful smile lay the mind and eye of a meticulously hands-on designer. Charlotte's work ranges from typography and layouts to illustration and hand-sewn letter cushions.</p>
