    <h2 class="col1">The Power of People</h2>
    <p class="col2">We pick our people based on a number of things (and yes, modesty <em>is</em> one of them). There's a fine balance of skill, personality and initiative that we look for when recruiting for Modest.</p>
    <p class="col2">The fine humans below are our essence, each of them armed with their own particular set of skills they're like a turn-based card game. You could say they're our winning hand... #punderful</p>

      <h2>Marcus</h2>
      <p>Marcus has never really found his place, but don't feel bad for him because in looking for it he's worn a ton of hats and now knows what he loves he can do all the things he loves was by founding this place. Now he gets to gallivant about making stuff. Good for him, good for our clients who get a genuine passion.</p>

      <h2>Steve</h2>
      <p>Steve is the guy who knows what needs to be known about back-end technologies and databases. Does that sound boring? Most likely, however, having a solid back-end and a well designed database means quality data and fast speeds. If all the websites that used databases didn't exist... well, that <em>would</em> be boring.</p>

      <h2>Solly</h2>
      <p>Behind the magical charm, chiselled muscles and ravishing good looks (like really, really, ridiculously good looking) he's just like the rest of us. Except I forgot to mention that he's also really smart and knows his way around a computer. From build to code â€“ this guy's front-end skill is incredible... but he won't tell you that. That's why we like him.</p>

      <h2>Charlotte</h2>
      <p>Some say she's only here because she's sleeping with the boss (he <em>is</em> dreamy), but once you see what she can do you'll soon realise that behind her perfectly styled hair and beautiful smile lay the mind and eye of a meticulously hands-on designer. Charlotte's work ranges from typography and layouts to illustration and hand-sewn letter cushions.</p>
