      <h2>Sweat Roulette</h2>
      <p>Sweat Roulette is a cross-platform web-app we built to help you keep fit. There's one rule; do the exercise it says on the screen. Each one will last for 20-40 seconds before changing. Do the exercise as hard as you can for as long as you can. One exercise is equal to one point so once you're done you can tweet your score for bragging (or slagging) rights.</p>
