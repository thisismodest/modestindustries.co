      <p>Sweat Roulette is a cross-platform prototype made to help you get fit. It's easy to get started, there's only one rule â€“ do the exercise for as long as it says on the screen.</p>
      <p>Each exercise will last for 20-40 seconds before changing. Keep going as hard as you can for as long as you can. One point per exercise so once you're done, tweet your score. #humblebrag.</p>
