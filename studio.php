      <p>We love photography. Having the skills and equipment in our studio to take photos of products, people, animals and anything else we can fit through the door means we spend less time looking for stock photos and more time working on something original for your project.</p>

    <div class="alt-box">
      <img src="img/gif/devices.gif">
      <p>There is a vast catalogue of devices, screen-sizes, browsers, operating systems â€“ the list goes on. We have a mix of laptops, tablets and mobile devices using the latest software so that we can run the tests needed to make sure what we build works where you need it to.</p>

      <img src="img/placeholder-phone.jpg">
      <p>When we need to build bespoke props, mock up packaging concepts or build a stand to help hold something up we can pop into the shed. Tearing ourselves away from technology to build something in real life is great for giving a project something unique and a nice personal touch.</p>
