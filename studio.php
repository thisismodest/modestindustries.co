    <h2 class="col1">Photography Studio</h2>
    <img src="img/placeholder-phone.jpg" class="col2 col-image">
    <p class="col2 col-text">Images speak a thousand words, but all we really want is to make someone smile. Our set up is capable of snapping anything that can fit through a door. People, products, animals (preferably cute and fluffy) and everything else we haven't thought of yet. Here's a fun fact; every photo on this website was produced by us.</p>

    <h2 class="col1">Multi-device Dev Test Bench</h2>
    <img src="img/placeholder-phone.jpg" class="col2 col-image">
    <p class="col2 col-text">Over the years technology has grown exponentially and because of this there is a vast catalogue of devices, screen-sizes, browsers, programming languages, operating systems... the list goes on. To make sure what we build works where you need it to, we have a mix of laptops, tablets and mobile devices running the most popular software to run our builds on.</p>

    <h2 class="col1">Crafting Shed</h2>
    <img src="img/placeholder-phone.jpg" class="col2 col-image">
    <p class="col2 col-text">When we need to build bespoke props, mock up packaging concepts or build a stand to help hold something up we can pop into the shed. Tearing ourselves away from technology to build something in real life is great for giving a project something unique and a nice personal touch.</p>

    <h2 class="col1">Visit us</h2>
    <img src="img/placeholder-phone.jpg" class="col2 col-image">
    <p class="col2 col-text">A change of scenery can do wonders for the mind which is why we extend an open-invite to all of our clients to visit us and work from our studio. We offer a welcoming and productive environment and are always happy to candidly bounce ideas around.</p>
